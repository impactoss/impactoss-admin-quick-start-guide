# Admin Quick Start Guide

## Introduction

This guide is a brief introduction into the features and components of **IMPACT OSS**, the Open Source Software (OSS) for Integrated Management and Planning of Actions (IMPACT), as well as selected use cases. IMPACT OSS was created to assist States with coordinating and monitoring implementation of human rights and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (also see [History & credits](/appendix/history.md)).

This guide is aimed at **admin users only** that are tasked with editing the content or overseeing content editing. It complements the full **[IMPACT OSS User Manual](https://user-manual.impactoss.org)** that describes the application in more detail and also includes guidance for public audiences (also see [Types of users](/info/usertypes.md)).


> This guide is based on the basic "Rights only" demo configuration that can be found here [demo-rights.impactoss.org](https://demo-rights.impactoss.org)
