### Navigation

IMPACT OSS database content can be explored using several different

* **menus** (that mostly link lists of individual content items stored in the database (such as recommendations or actions)), and
* **content links** (that link to individual content items either from a list view or another single item view).

####  Menus

Except on the welcome page, IMPACT OSS offers three levels of navigation for exploring and managing the database content (for a full list of available views please see **[Pages](info/components.md)**):

1. **Primary navigation** for exploring and managing the **principal content** (see [Features](/intro/features.md)). Also includes the **overview** page for exploring the categories (see below) and **search** page to quickly search the entire database
2. **Secondary navigation** for exploring and managing **editorial pages**, as well as **user accounts**. This also includes links for user registration and login.
3. **Additional navigation and filtering** for additional options where content is grouped (e.g. the different category types (taxonomies) that are part of the **overview** page) or where content can be filtered

#### Content links

In addition users can explore individual content items by selecting them from its **list view** or a related **single item views**. List items also display any related items, including the color-coded category 'tags', that can be used to navigate as well.

##### List view

On any list view:

1. Open item: click item title
2. Open item ![](/assets/icon-categories_small.png) category: click one of item category tags
3. Open related item (e.g. an ![](/assets/icon-action_small.png) action associated with a recommendation): hover over relationship count and then click related item title in pop-up

##### Single item view

On any single item view:

1. Open related item (e.g. an ![](/assets/icon-action_small.png) action associated with a recommendation): click item title. Here you can also open on any related categories or related items of the related item just like on the list views.
2. Open item ![](/assets/icon-categories_small.png) category: click one of item category titles
