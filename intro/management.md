### Managing content

Rather than having a separate "back-end" (or admin portal) to manage content, IMPACT OSS allows editing content right through the "front-end" (or public User Interface): additional options and information become available to "admin" users once logged in (registered users with sufficient privileges, see also **[Types of users](/info/usertypes.md)**).

##### List view

So on any list view (see 'Recommendations list' pictured below) admin users will be offered with additional options:

1. **Batch edit options** to update multiple list items at once
2. **Item select options** to select one or more items for batch editing
3. **Create options** to create a single list item or import multiple items at once

Other admin features are (4) Page and User Admin pages and (6) seeing unpublished 'DRAFT' content. All logged in users will (5) see their user name that allows accessing their user account.

##### Single item view

On single item views (see 'Single Recommendation' pictured below) admin users will find:

1. **Edit option** for updating and deleting single items
2. **Meta information** with additional information about the most recent update as well as creation date
