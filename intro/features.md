### Features

IMPACT OSS is a software created to assist States with coordinating and monitoring implementation of human rights and the SDGs, and also communicate implementation progress to the public.

#### Maintaining content

With IMPACT OSS you can create, publish, update and finally also link the required content items:
* **UN recommendations** that States receive from Treaty Bodies and other UN human rights mechanisms;
* **Government actions** that Governments define to address the recommendations (and optionally also the 169 SDG targets);
* **Indicators** that allow tracking implementation progress and outcomes
* **Clusters & categories** that group and characterise recommendations and actions
* **Pages** for providing context and editorial content
* Optionally: the 169 **SDG targets** for the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

#### Batch features for maintaining multiple items at once

In addition to allowing these items to be created and maintained individually and one-by-one, IMPACT OSS comes equipped with some powerful batch features that allow creating or updating multiple items at once.

##### Import: create multiple items

IMPACT OSS allows creating multiple items at once by using the import feature that is available for recommendations, actions, and indicators. The import feature requires the content to be prepared and saved as a CSV text file that can be edited using appropriate spreadsheet software such as MS Excel. CSV templates can be downloaded for each item that include all the required and optional attributes.

##### Batch edit: update multiple items

With IMPACT OSS you can also update multiple items at once, as well as link multiple items with multiple other items, for example assigning multiple recommendations to a recommendation cluster or linking multiple actions with all recommendations of a recommendation cluster that they address.

#### Exploring content

IMPACT OSS provides different ways to explore the content

##### Category breakdowns

Visual breakdowns of recommendations and actions by categories are provided to facilitate high-level analyses.

##### Filtering content

Recommendation and action overview lists can be filtered by
* reference or keyword (contained in title)
* category (any tag associated with item, e.g. recommendation cluster, treaty body, etc)
* connection (any other linked item)
* connected categories (any tag associated with any linked item)
* attribute (selected attributes, e.g. publication status)

##### Implementation plan view

The implementation plan view allows drilling down to show any progress reports and upcoming due dates nested within the list of actions.

---

#### Reporting & follow-up

Once actions have been entered and published, implementation progress and outcomes must be regularly documented.

##### Progress reports

With IMPACT OSS multiple progress reports can be created for each action (or also group of actions) to document the implementation progress and outcomes (linked via indicators).

##### Reporting schedule

A reporting schedule of due dates can be created if progress reports are required at regular intervals.

##### Automated Email reminders

When a progress report is due, IMPACT OSS will send out automated email reminders directly to the responsible user. Once the due date passes, additional reminders are sent to another user responsible to oversee multiple actions.
