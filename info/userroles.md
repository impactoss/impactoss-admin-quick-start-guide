## User roles

In IMPACT OSS registered users have one of the following roles (ordered by increasing privileges). Typically most users would be contributors or managers and only a few would be administrators.

### Guest (no role assigned)

Once a website visitor registers, they will immediately assume the implicit role **Guest**.

Compared to visitors that have not registered **guests** can

* log in
* reset their password
* update their own user profile
* contribute a draft progress report for any indicator (a draft report will not be publicly visible unless a manager or administrator explicitly publishes it)
* be promoted (by a manager or administrator)

### Contributor

**Contributors** are users that can be made responsible for contributing **progress reports** to an indicator they have been assigned to.

In addition to the guest privileges (see above), **contributors** can

* view all draft content
* be assigned to one or more indicators (by a manager or administrator)
* receive email reminders for contributing progress reports for indicators they have been assigned to (if a reporting schedule has been set up by a manager or administrator)
* contribute and publish a progress report for the indicator they have been assigned to

### Manager

**Managers** are users that can with few exceptions (see Administrators below) manage all the content of IMPACT OSS.

In addition to the contributor privileges (see above), **managers** can

* create and publish recommendations, actions, indicators, progress reports, SDG targets (if configured) and categories (tags)
* be assigned to a category to oversee reporting for all indicators linked (via recommendations and/or actions) with that category (by an administrator)
* promote guests to become contributors (as well as demote accordingly)
* assign contributors to indicators

### Administrator

**Administrators** have all available privileges

In addition to the manager privileges (see above), **administrators** can

* create and publish pages
* delete content
* promote users to contributor, manager or administrator (as well as demote accordingly)
* assign managers to categories
