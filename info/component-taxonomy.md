#### Category breakdowns

##### About

For each category grouping (or taxonomy) a visual category breakdown is provided that lists each category within the selected grouping and visualises the number of associated or tagged recommendations and actions as bars.

> Note: where categories only tag recommendations and not actions, the breakdown shows 'inferred' or actions that are associated with the tagged recommendations

##### To open a category breakdown

1. Go to **Overview** (see above)
2. Select a category grouping from the left hand side bar

> Note: some installations may also have a link to the Category breakdowns as a separate menu item in the main navigation

##### Here you can also

* Create new categories for each grouping
