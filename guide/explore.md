### Explore: filter, group & sort items

This set-by-step guide will show you how to customise the list views of **Recommendations** and **Government actions** (also referred to as the **Implementation plan**) to allow exploring the database content effectively. Filtering is also essential for using the powerful batch editing feature (see [Batch edit: update multiple](/guide/batch-edit.md)).

The available list view options are:
* Filter list items
* Group list items
* Sort list items
* Change view mode (Action implementation plan only)

> Please note, that the order of the following steps is for demonstration purposes only. They can be taken and repeated in any order.

> Also note: the following screenshots are either showing recommendation OR action lists but unless otherwise stated they are applicable to both (in fact they also apply in principal to any other list page, including **User admin**, **Page admin**, and **Indicator list**, as well as **SDG target** list if configured)

#### 1. Go to list page

To go to the list of recommendations simply select **Recommendations** from the primary navigation menu, for the list of actions that form the implementation plan select **Implementation plan** (also see [Navigation](/intro/navigation.md)).

> Note: depending on your configuration menu item names may differ

---

#### 2. Filter recommendations or actions

Without filtering, the list pages will list all items contained in the database. Therefore, the first thing you may want to do is filter the list so that you will only be presented with those items that are currently relevant.

In theory, you can apply as many filters as you like, but please note that all **active filters are always applied**. This means that only those items are shown that match **ALL** active filters.

The available filter options are (again these can be mixed and applied in any order):

##### Filter by keyword

By typing into the search field you can filter list items by keyword, targeting each list item's title, and unique reference (sometime database id).

##### Filter by attribute

You can filter items by specific attributes and characteristics by following these steps:

1. Enable **Filter** mode if not already active
2. Click on an attribute (e.g. **Publication status**) in the **Filter by attribute** section of filter options
3. Click or select the attribute value (e.g. **Draft**) that you would like the list items to match. Note that for each value the number of matching items is displayed (under consideration of all other active filter options).

##### Filter by category

You can filter the list items by any category they have been tagged with (see for example [Recommendations: enter & cluster](/guide/enter-recommendations.md)):

1. Enable **Filter** mode if not already active
2. Click on a classification (e.g. **Recommending mechanism**) in the **Filter by category** section of filter options (note: you can also hide and show these classifications by clicking on the section title)
3. Optionally filter available categories by keyword
4. Click or select the category (e.g. **Universal Periodic Review**) that you would like the list items to match.

##### Filter by related category (action implementation plan only)

Actions can also be filtered by any category a linked recommendation is tagged with. This allows for example getting a list of all actions that are linked with recommendations of a specific **Recommending mechanism**. The steps are:

1. Enable **Filter** mode if not already active
2. Click on an classification (e.g. **Recommending mechanism**) in the **Filter by related category** section of filter options (note: you can also hide and show these classifications by clicking on the section title)
3. Optionally filter available categories by keyword
4. Click or select the related category (e.g. **Universal Periodic Review**) that you would like the actions to match.

##### Filter by relationship

Further you can filter list items by relationship, resulting for example in a list that shows all recommendations that have been associated with a specific action.

1. Enable **Filter** mode if not already active
2. Click on an item type (e.g. **Implementing actions**) in the **Filter by relationship** section of filter options (note: you can also hide and show these types by clicking on the section title)
3. Optionally filter available relationships by keyword or category.
4. Click or select the related item that you would like the items to be associated with.

> Hint: to remove any filter options just repeat the same steps, unselecting the active filter option in the last step, or simply click on the filter tag in the keyword search bar.

---

#### 3. Group recommendations and actions

List items can be grouped by any classification that list items can be tagged with. In addition items can be grouped again within each group.

> Note: depending on the specific configuration, items can already be grouped by default, e.g. by Recommendation Cluster and/or by Organisation as pictured below

To customise the list groups:

##### 3.1. Select main group classification

Below the keyword search box and above the list, simply select a classification from the **Group by** dropdown.

> Note: if a classification is already selected, remove it by clicking the classification name or the **X** next to it. This will also remove any subgroup classification.

##### 3.2. Select subgroup classification

If a main group classification is set, you can select another classification from the **Subgroup by** dropdown.

---

#### 4. Sort recommendations and actions

List items can also be sorted by creation date (often default), title, reference (recommendations only), target date (actions only) and last update.

To customise the order of list items:

##### 4.1. Select sort attribute

Below the keyword search box and on the right of the list header, select an attribute from the dropdown.

##### 4.2. Select sort order

In addition, you can specify the sort order by clicking on the sort order icon right next to the attribute dropdown

> Hint: when grouped, sorting is applied only within each group and subgroup, so if you want true sorting of all objects you must remove any grouping settings first (see above)

---

#### 5. Change view mode (action implementation plan only)

For the Implementation Plan or action list view an additional view mode is available. In addition to the default **List view** an **Implementation view** is offered that allows users to drill into any associated indicators, as well as scheduled and existing progress reports.

Where the list view only shows the numbers of nested indicators and progress reports (remember: each action can have multiple indicators and each indicator multiple progress reports), the implementation plan view will expand these nested items into nested item lists.

There are three different ways to change the view mode:

##### 'View mode' link (1)

Simply click on the view mode link which is located above the list header on the right and is labelled either with **List view** or **Implementation view**

##### Summary (2)

Alternatively, you can click on any nested summary to expand the list one column at a time. Clicking on an indicator summary will expand the second column but still only show summaries of the third progress report column. Clicking on a progress report summary will always expand both columns.

> Note: minimising expanded columns is only possible using the 'view mode' link (see above) or the column headers (see below)

##### Column headers (3)

Finally, just like using the summary boxes to drill down (see above), you can also expand the list one column at a time by clicking on the respective column headers. Unlike for the summary boxes, you can collapse the columns by clicking once more.
