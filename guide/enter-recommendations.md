### Enter & cluster recommendations

This step-by-step guide will teach you how to manually enter, tag and cluster human rights recommendations. Alternatively multiple recommendations can also be created at once using the CSV import feature (see [Import recommendations](/guide/import.md)) and linked using the batch edit feature (see [Update multiple recommendations](/guide/batch-edit.md)).

#### Pre-requisites: registered, promoted and logged in

In order to enter and cluster recommendations you will need to

1. be registered
2. be promoted to a 'Manager' or 'Administrator' user role (see **[User roles](/info/userroles.md)**)
3. logged in

---

#### 1. Enter a human rights recommendation

Steps for entering a human rights recommendation:

##### 1.1. Go to the 'Recommendation list' page

From the primary menu select 'Recommendations'.

##### 1.2. Click 'Add Recommendation +'

The 'New recommendation' page can be opened by clicking the 'Add Recommendation +' button.

> Note: only logged in users with sufficient privileges, namely users with user role 'Manager' or 'Administrator' will have this option

##### 1.3. Enter recommendation details

Enter the recommendation details according to the available attributes (required fields are marked with **\***):

1. **Reference**: A unique reference that allows to easily identify a particular recommendation. For references it is best to use any references or numbers if provided by the recommending mechanism and thus allow universal identification and if not a sensible numbering.
  > Note: rather than using just numbers, it is better to also encode the mechanism and cycle (or year) to guarantee long-term uniqueness and consistency. Bad examples would be using 5 and 6 as there may be many 5th recommendations across different mechanisms and cycles, a good example would be CRC-2017-5 and CRC-2017-6 as it will always be unique))

2. **Title**: The full text or public title of a recommendation or observation.
  > Note: some configurations offer an additional optional field 'Full recommendation text' in which case a less technical and shorter title can be entered here (also aimed at public audiences).

3. **Publication status**: Leave in 'Draft' to keep the recommendation private for now, or change to 'Public' to make it public right when you save it.
  > Note: Leaving it in 'Draft' will give you or your colleagues the chance to review it first. Then you can come back and publish it later.

> Note: other configurations may offer additional attributes, i.e. **Full recommendation text**, **Government response**, **Government response comment**.

##### 1.4. Cluster and group recommendations

Below on the right you can assign one or more categories for each classification. By doing so the wide ranging obligations become more manageable and easier to track.

In particular you should at least assign:

1. One **Recommending mechanism** (alternatively called 'Human rights body' or 'Human rights mechanism')
2. One **Reporting cycle**
3. One or more **Recommendation clusters** (if available, alternatively called 'Thematic cluster')

Further you can assign one or more categories of any of the other available classifications (depending on the specific configuration). These could include:
* **Themes** (alternatively called 'Human rights issues')
* **Human rights**
* **Affected persons groups** (alternatively called 'Affected persons')
* **Sustainable Development Goals**
* **Recommending state** (applicable to URG recommendations only)

For each classification:

###### 1.4.1. Open classification options (the categories)

Simply click on the classification title.

###### 1.4.2. Optional: filter options by keyword

Simply enter a (partial) keyword to filter the list of options.

###### 1.4.3. Optional: create a new category

If your category is not yet available, you can create a new category by clicking 'Add +' at the bottom left of the options panel.

Enter the category details just like entering the recommendation details (see 1.3. above) and hit 'SAVE' at the bottom of the 'New category' dialogue.

The category attributes are:

1. **Reference**: An optional reference of the category where applicable. Can also be used for forcing sort order (by default categories are ordered by title unless a reference is provided).
2. **Title**: The name of the category or cluster.
3. **Publication status**: Select 'Draft' to keep the category private or change to 'Public' to make it public right away.
4. **Short title**: Optional: a short name for the category as used for category tags. If left blank application will display an abbreviation of the Title.   
5. **Description**: Optional: a description of the category. Can also include any commentary provided.
6. **Website**: Optional: any external website address that may provide further information about the category.

###### 1.4.4. Close classification options

Click 'Close' at the bottom of the option panel.

##### 1.5. Optional: link government actions

If you already have actions in the database that you would want to link the recommendation to or if you want to create a new action on the fly, you can do so in the 'Relationships' section on the bottom left just as described for associating categories above (see 1.4.).

> Note: For the purpose of this guide however we omit this step and instead create, categorise and link actions in a separate step (see [Enter & link actions](/guide/enter-actions.md))

##### 1.6. Save recommendation

Once you are satisfied with the details entered and categories associated, hit the 'SAVE' button at the top or bottom of the form. Do not worry if you have forgotten some category associations or so not have available all the information required - you can always update the recommendation at a later stage.

---

#### 2. Review recommendation

If saved successfully you will be taken to the 'single recommendation page' of the recommendation just created. Here you can review all the information entered and click 'Edit' to fix any errors you may find, add any linkages, and also publish or _unpublish_ the recommendation (see 3. below)

---

#### 3. Publish recommendation

If you have not done so right away, you can publish a 'Draft' recommendation as follows:

##### 3.1. Click 'EDIT'

Click 'EDIT' to open the 'recommendation edit' page.

##### 3.2. Change 'Publication Status' to 'Public'

From the 'Publication Status' dropdown on the top right, select 'Public'.

##### 3.3. Save recommendation

Click 'SAVE' at the top or bottom of the screen (see also 1.6. above)
