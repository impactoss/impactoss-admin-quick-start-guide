### Actions: enter & link

This step-by-step guide will teach you how to manually enter, and tag government actions as well as link them with human rights recommendations they address. Just like recommendations, multiple actions can alternatively be created at once using the CSV import feature (similar to [Import recommendations](/guide/import.md)) and linked using the batch edit feature (similar to [Update multiple recommendations](/guide/batch-edit.md)).

#### Pre-requisites: registered, promoted and logged in

In order to enter and cluster recommendations you will need to

1. be registered
2. be promoted to a 'Manager' or 'Administrator' user role (see **[User roles](/info/userroles.md)**)
3. logged in

Further this assumes that you have already entered and clustered some recommendations (see [Enter & cluster recommendations](/guide/enter-recommendations.md)).

---

#### 1. Enter an action

Steps for entering a government action:

##### 1.1. Go to the 'Implementation plan' page

From the primary menu select 'Implementation plan' that lists all existing actions.

##### 1.2. Click 'Add implementing action +'

The 'New action' page can be opened by clicking the 'Add implementing action +' button.

> Note: only logged in users with sufficient privileges, namely users with user role 'Manager' or 'Administrator' will have this option

##### 1.3. Enter action details

Enter the action details according to the available attributes (required fields are marked with **\***):

1. **Title**: The full text or public title of a recommendation or observation.
  > Note: some configurations offer an additional optional field 'Full recommendation text' in which case a less technical and shorter title can be entered here (also aimed at public audiences).

2. **Publication status**: Leave in 'Draft' to keep the recommendation private for now, or change to 'Public' to make it public right when you save it.
  > Note: Leaving it in 'Draft' will give you or your colleagues the chance to review it first. Then you can come back and publish it later.

3. **Description**: A detailed description of the action

4. **Target date**: The date by when the government aims to have the action implemented.

5. **Target date comment**: Any comment to further explain the target date.

> Note: other configurations may offer additional attributes, i.e. **Outcome**, **Indicator summary**.

##### 1.4. Cluster and group actions

Below on the right you can assign one or more categories for each available classification. By doing so the wide ranging actions become more manageable and easier to track.

In particular you can assign:

1. One or more **Recommendation clusters** if the action is relevant for a cluster of recommendations (if available, alternatively called 'Thematic cluster')
  > Note: currently IMPACT OSS will not offer to link actions and recommendations based on shared cluster assignments. Instead you will also have to link recommendations (see 1.5. below)

2. One **Implementing agency**
3. A **Progress status**

Further you can assign one or more categories of any of the other available classifications (depending on the specific configuration). These could include:
* **Themes** (alternatively called 'Human rights issues')
* **SMART criteria**

Please refer to step 1.4. of section [Enter & cluster recommendations](/guide/enter-recommendations.md) to learn how to assign existing or new categories.

##### 1.5. Link recommendations

You can now link the action with one or more recommendations it addresses.

> Note: just like creating new categories on the fly, you could also create new recommendations from within the recommendation option panel, however it does not allow associating the so-created recommendations to clusters or categories.

###### 1.5.1. Open available recommendations

Simply click on the 'Recommendations' drop down.

###### 1.5.2. Optional: filter recommendation by keyword, cluster or other category

You can filter the list of recommendations by:
* Keyword or reference by typing it into the text field.
* Cluster or other category. This is specifically helpful if the action should address all or multiple recommendations of a recommendation cluster. Just click the checkbox to select all filtered recommendations

###### 1.4.3. Close recommendation options

Finally click 'Close' at the bottom of the option panel.

##### 1.6. Create and link progress indicator

Just like categories and recommendations, you can also link to a new or existing progress indicator.

###### 1.6.1. Open indicator options

Simply click on the 'indicators' drop down.

###### 1.6.2. Optional: filter options by keyword

Simply enter a (partial) keyword to filter the list of options.

###### 1.6.3. Optional: create a new indicator

If a suitable progress indicator is not yet available, you can create it by clicking 'Add +' at the bottom left of the options panel.

Enter the indicator details and hit 'SAVE' at the bottom of the 'New indicator' dialogue.

The indicator attributes are:

1. **Reference**: An optional reference for the indicator. If left blank the database record id is automatically assigned.
2. **Title**: The name of the indicator.
3. **Publication status**: Select 'Draft' to keep the indicator private or change to 'Public' to make it public right away.
4. **Description**: Optional: a description of the indicator.

> Note: currently IMPACT OSS does not offer assigning responsible users and setting up a reporting schedule for the newly created indicator right from within the new action page. These will have to be set up from the 'edit indicator page' instead.


###### 1.6.4. Close indicator options

Click 'Close' at the bottom of the option panel.

##### 1.7. Save action

Once you are satisfied with the details entered and categories associated, hit the 'SAVE' button at the top or bottom of the form. Do not worry if you have forgotten some category associations or so not have available all the information required - you can always come back and update the action at a later stage.

---

#### 2. Review action

If saved successfully you will be taken to the 'single action page' of the action just created. Here you can review all the information entered and click 'Edit' to fix any errors you may find, add any linkages, and also publish or _unpublish_ the action you just created (see 3. below)

---

#### 3. Publish action

If you have not done so right away, you can publish a 'Draft' action as follows:

##### 3.1. Click 'EDIT'

Click 'EDIT' to open the 'action edit' page.

##### 3.2. Change 'Publication Status' to 'Public'

From the 'Publication Status' dropdown on the top right, select 'Public'.

##### 3.3. Save action

Click 'SAVE' at the top or bottom of the screen (see also 1.6. above)
