#### Pre-requisites: knowledge of the different user roles

Before inviting and promoting new users it is expected that you have familiarised yourself with the different user roles in IMPACT OSS. If not please see **[User roles](/info/userroles.md)**.

---

#### 1. Invite a user

Send the user an email and **share a link to the registration page**.

> Hint: ask the new user to let you know once they have registered

---

#### 2. Promote a user

Steps for promoting a newly registered user:

##### 2.1. Reload application

Reload the application to get the latest data from the database that shall include the newly registered user.

> Hint: pressing F5 will reload the current page in most browsers

##### 2.2. Go to the 'User admin' page

The **User admin** page is located in the secondary menu at the top of the page (also see [Navigation](/intro/navigation.md))

A single user can be opened by clicking on their **name** (also see [Navigation](/intro/navigation.md))

> Note: you can also type the user name into the filter text field to filter the list to locate the user
