## 2. Step by step

### Invite & promote users

This step-by-step guide explains how website administrators can get other qualified users onboard to help manage and monitor the implementation plan and other database content.

#### Pre-requisites: knowledge of the different user roles

Before inviting and promoting new users it is expected that you have familiarised yourself with the different user roles in IMPACT OSS. If not please see **[User roles](/info/userroles.md)**.

#### 1. Invite a user

Send the user an email and **share a link to the registration page**. Currently users cannot yet be invited through the application.

> Hint: if you do not want to keep re-loading the list of users and wait until the new user has signed up, ask the new user to let you know once they have registered

#### 2. Promote a user

Steps for promoting a newly registered user:

##### 2.1. Reload application

Reload the application to get the latest data from the database that shall include the newly registered user.

> Hint: pressing F5 will reload the current page in most browsers

##### 2.2. Go to the 'User admin' page

The **User admin** page is located in the secondary menu at the top of the page (also see [Navigation](/intro/navigation.md))

##### 2.3. Open the single user page

A single user can be opened by clicking on their **name** (also see [Navigation](/intro/navigation.md))

> Note: you can also type the user name into the filter text field to filter the list to locate the user

##### 2.4. Click 'EDIT'

Click **EDIT** to open the single user edit page (also see [Managing content](/intro/management.md))

##### 2.6. Hit 'SAVE' on the top or bottom of the screen.

This will **save** the new user role and return you to the single user page

#### 3. Inform user

Contact the new user and let them know that they have been promoted.

**IMPORTANT: the new user will have to reload the application to get the privileges of the newly assigned role**
