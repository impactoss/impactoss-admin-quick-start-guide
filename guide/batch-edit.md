> Note: the following screenshots are either showing recommendation OR action lists but unless otherwise stated they are applicable to both (in fact they also apply in principal to any other list page, including **User admin**, **Page admin**, and **Indicator list**, as well as **SDG target** list if configured)

---

#### Pre-requisites: registered, promoted and logged in

In order to enter and cluster recommendations you will need to

1. be registered
2. be promoted to a 'Manager' or 'Administrator' user role (see **[User roles](/info/userroles.md)**)
3. logged in

---

#### 1. Go to list page

To go to the list of recommendations simply select **Recommendations** from the primary navigation menu, for the list of actions that form the implementation plan select **Implementation plan** (also see [Navigation](/intro/navigation.md)).

> Note: depending on your configuration menu item names may differ

---

#### 2. Optionally: filter recommendations or actions

While you can simply scroll through the entire list and select the items you wish to update one by one, with many items in your list it is more efficient to filter the list first by any of the available filter options. Please refer to the **[Explore: filter, group & sort items](/guide/explore.md)** for step-by-step-instructions.

---

#### 3. Select recommendations or actions

##### Select items individually

To select those items that you wish to update simply activate the checkbox next to each list item individually.

> Please note: **Edit** mode is automatically enabled if at least one item is selected. You can alternatively also manually enable the **Edit** mode and then select the items.

##### Select all items at once

Alternatively you can activate the checkbox at the top of the list (1 in screenshot below) that will select all visible items on the current list page. Then you can optionally chose to also select all items in the current list including those not on the current page (2).

You can also use this checkbox to unselect any selected items.

#### 4. Update recommendations or actions

Once the relevant items have been selected you can then use the sidebar menu to assign any category or connection. In particular follow these steps:

##### 4.1. Open the edit options

To open the edit options, simply click on the title of the attribute, classification or relationship you wish to update.

> Please note: options already active for all or some of the selected list items are already checked (**âœ“**) or marked with a horizontal line (**-**).

##### 4.2. Optional: filter options

For classification and relationship edit options the list can be filtered by simply entering a (partial) keyword in the text field. In addition, relationship options offer filtering the list by category.

##### 4.3. Optional: create a new option

If the desired category or relationship does not yet exist you can create it on the fly by licking on the **Add +** button at the bottom left of the option panel (just as it is possible when associating recommendations (see [Recommendations: enter & cluster](/guide/enter-recommendations.md)) or actions (see [Actions: enter & link](/guide/enter-actions.md)) individually from the respective create and edit pages).
